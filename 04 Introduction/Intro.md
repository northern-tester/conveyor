# Introduction Ideas

* Title page - something amusing
* Suman
* Ash
* Whats the point in pipelines
  * Testing (and building things) without deploying is a bit pointless
  * Time taken to start testing - testable applications reliably deployed
  * Pipelines facilitate balanced testing, different environments are suited to different testing techniques
  * Operability needs testing too, ways you can contribute as testers in a changing world
* Heuristics of the room
  * Ask questions
  * Help people around you
  * Flag technical problems on the board here and how you solved them
* What are the learning objectives
  * We have three exercises
    * Recognise the terminology and techniques applied to building and maintaining deployment pipelines
    * Understand the principles of pipeline design through analysing new or existing tests, test strategies and environments available.
    * Apply these principles to building a multi stage pipeline with Jenkins
* Check in
  * Have used Jenkins (or similar tooling) before?
  * Just so we can equalise the tables out a bit and get people to help out.
