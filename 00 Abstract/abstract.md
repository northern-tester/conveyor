# Realising Testing Value Through Deployment Pipelines

## Introduction to the problem or opportunity

Throughout our careers we have seen a lot of test automation and performance testing created but never executed as part of a pipeline. Often these assets would be run locally and after a while, those tests become stale as they are not visible to the whole team, sometimes even regressing back to manual regression testing cycles over time. Often there is an existing pipeline that may run build and unit tests, but not include the other forms of testing that are needed to meet the level of quality that the organisation values for that application.

We would like explore the value of building and tailoring pipelines to include many forms of testing. The skills of advocacy, test strategy, analysis and critical thinking are equally as important as technically focused skills such as source control in this area.

## Why it is important for testers

We believe that testers will benefit from this set of skills by:

* Sharing tooling between developers, testers and operational focused team members can foster collaboration and empathy, leading to teams forming and aiming towards common goals.
* Testers can leverage their analytical skills to tailor a pipeline relevant to their organisations needs. Pipelines can be targeted at what the organisation values, running resilience tests if that is the focus early if uptime is valued or performance tests if speed is the focus.
* As DevOps principles and practices spread to many organisations, testers will need to find alternative ways to add value to their teams. Contributions to quality such as being able to deploy your application in a safe manner are increasingly important as customer demand and application complexity increase.
* Test environments are often appropriate for different forms of testing, end to end testing in integrated environments or early exploratory testing in development environments can be added to a pipeline.
* Represently your existing test strategy within a new or existing pipeline, helping their team to achieve a balanced test approach.

Having many layers of test automation only realises its true value when executed as part of a deployment pipeline. If testers are to make a real impact as they switch to automation focused roles, the main differentiator will be the ability to run those tests as part of deploying applications in safe and stable manner. With the goal of making your release process a business advantage instead of a limitation.

## Key takeaways

We believe that after the workshop each attendee will be able to:

* Recognise the terminology and techniques applied to building and maintaining deployment pipelines
* Understand the principles of pipeline design through analysing new or existing tests, test strategies and environments available.
* Apply these principles to building a multi stage pipeline with Jenkins 

## Experience and relevance

Ash and Suman are hoping to run their first workshop together, Ash has done this before a few times and would like to pair with people to create new content and hopefully pass on a bit of this learning and learn something new himself. Suman has run technical workshops and presented internally in her role at Sky, and would really like to make the next step to presenting content at conferences. She is also part of the Ministry of Testing Leeds organisation committee, plus has been a compere at the Leeds Tester Gathering.
