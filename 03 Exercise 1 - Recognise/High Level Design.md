# Recognise the terminology and techniques applied to building and maintaining deployment pipelines (10-20mins)

* This is our 0-5 exercise
* Docker - introduction to containers
  * Get everyone installed
  * Difference between containers, VM and host
* Jenkins - introduction to pipelines
  * Get everyone installed, setup steps
  * How/what is a pipeline - codification of a set of manual steps
* Github - clone the repos needed

## Bringing pipelines to life while introducing key technologies

* I think we can add some terms and terminology games in here.
* Create 10 terms or commands for Containerisation and Pipelines and get people to match them
* Basically build a reference 

## Build a reference sheet by getting installed

### Experience - Do Something

* Docker
  * Get everyone to check their installs but running a number of commands
  * Match the commands to their use cases
* Jenkins
  * Do the pull latest jenkins instance and maybe a docker agent
  * Match the jenkins terminology to explanation and use case

### Reflect - Review the experience

* Both
  * Get a team or two to present back on the reference sheets
  * Show of hands for installs

### Learn - Conclude from the reflection

* Get everyone to post their reference sheets on the wall near their workspace

### Experiment - Try out what you have learnt

* Get the container names
* Get the IP addresses from within the containers themselves
