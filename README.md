# Realising Testing Value Through Deployment Pipelines

## Description of Workshop

Throughout our careers we have seen a lot of test automation and performance testing created but never executed as part of a pipeline. Often these assets would be run locally and after a while, those tests become stale as they are not visible to the whole team, sometimes even regressing back to manual regression testing cycles over time. Often there is an existing pipeline that may run build and unit tests, but not include the other forms of testing that are needed to meet the level of quality that the organisation values for that application.

We would like explore the value of building and tailoring pipelines to include many forms of testing. The skills of advocacy, test strategy, analysis and critical thinking are equally as important as technically focused skills such as source control in this area.
